Hey there! Welcome to AERIS!

I’m Hari, a Principal Engineer at a cybersecurity startup called CloudSEK. I’ve always had a passion for writing, but I’ve never felt confident in my skills. This blog is my way of tackling that—sharing my thoughts and experiences while learning to express myself better.

AERIS-II is a mix of everything I love: technology, gaming, software engineering, and whatever else strikes my fancy. Whether it's deep dives into tech trends, tips on software development, or musings about my latest gaming obsession, I aim to share insights that anyone might find useful. Also I just loathe grinding/farming for materials in games.

What’s unique about AERIS? Well, it’s written by a senior in tech who still feels like a rookie when it comes to writing! I embrace the imperfections of my style, hoping it resonates with others who might be on a similar journey.

When I’m not working, you can find me lost in the world of gaming—I'm a huge fan of Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War 2, space games, and ARPGs. I’m also an avid fiction reader. I’ve completed the Malazan series, and right now, I’m diving into the works of Brandon Sanderson. I’ve always enjoyed books by Robert Ludlum and the author of The Da Vinci Code as well.

I’d love to connect! Don’t hesitate to toot or tweet at me on X and Hachyderm.io.

Thanks for stopping by AERIS—II hope you find something here that resonates with you!
