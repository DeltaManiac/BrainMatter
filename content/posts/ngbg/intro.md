# No Grind But Glory

I really love to play games. Like, _really_ love to play them. I play my favorite titles on my potato PC, which is almost 10 years old, and I even sneak in some gaming on my web browser at work. I started my gaming journey way back in 1998 with the OG DOOM, and I still haven’t stopped.

__No Grind But Glory__ (NGBG) is a series of posts where I explore the save files of the games I’ve played. My goal? To help cut down on grinding for materials, XP, and all those tedious tasks that can drag down the fun. If I come across anything interesting—whether it’s a small tip or a huge discovery—I’ll share it here in a technical blog post.
