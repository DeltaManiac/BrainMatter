## What is this game about?

Mechs V Kaijus - Tower Defense is a 2D indie game where you take the role of a commander whose sole aim is to protect humanity from extinction. You have some uber cool mechs that to aid you in this along with the entire military power of humanity and the game is just fantastic. 

This game has 2 important resources __Research__ and __Gold__ that are obtained after each mission based on the number of enemies killed and the mission difficulty.

__Research__ points are used to purchase upgrades for your towers and mechs. There is a sizeable tech-tree in the game that would require a hefty amount of research to unlock.

__Gold__ on the other hand is used to upgrade your mechs and buy support perks from the armory.

## Analyzing the save game

This one is pretty simple and convenient, its a JSON file again and pretty small one at that too.

1. **Step 1:** Open the save file (`User01SaveData.json`) in any text editor.

2. **Step 2:** Locate the `Gold` and `stars` entries—these are your resources.

   - `Gold` directly corresponds to your in-game gold.

   - `stars` represent research points.

3. **Step 3:** Edit the values to your liking. For example, I’ve changed my gold and research to 69420.

Save the file, and voila! You’re all set with maxed-out resources.

### A Few Notes on Editing


- While you can also edit your armory perks here, they can only be used once unlocked through gameplay. So editing them ahead of time won’t help.

- Similarly, you’ll need to unlock the tech tree upgrades manually, one by one, using research points.

Have fun—no more grinding necessary!
