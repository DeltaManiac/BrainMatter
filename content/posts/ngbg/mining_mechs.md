## What is this game about?

Mining Mechs is a 2D indie game where you control a mech to mine for resources.

The gameplay loop is simple, fun, and addictive:

    Mine for materials.
    Sell those materials for in-game currency.
    Upgrade your mech to mine faster and carry more materials.
    Repeat!

## Analyzing the save game

The save game is a plain JSON file, although it's quite large. It contains information like the map, items in the map, player stats, etc. Based on the screenshot from the game, the in-game currency value is displayed in the top-right corner:

To quickly find which field to modify, search for that value in the save file. Open your favorite text editor, hit `Ctrl+F`, and paste the value. In my case, it was __5370__, and I found it under `root.player_<id>.money`. I changed it to an arbitrary value __69420__ and the next time I launched the game, the change was reflected.

Have funâ€”no more grinding necessary for materials!
