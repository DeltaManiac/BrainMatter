Title : [ERR-7634]...Chimichanga
Content:</p>
<p>What connects 20000 years of Genocide? Too much power in a single hand</p>
<p>[ERR-7634]
There use be an all powerful "Chimichanga", powerful enough that the rivers flowed as his will decided. The flora and fauna were overwhelmed by his willpower that they could feel their very essence of soul being burnt up, their physical form fades to dust. He attained the power of such magnitude not by chance, but pure will and a cold and unwavering heart.

In his duel with the great protector of ŠzŸ-ÐNÒX Saint Lucan1x he had become too overconfident in his power that he thought the Saint wouldn't be able to shoot let alone kill him if he couldn't be seen. He could just disappear from the visual spectrum of Saint and simple Solar Infused knife thrown from the back would be the first and last blow for this so called "saint among peasants". He infused the blade in his hand with his will and it shone red with heat and hatred, threw it at the saints back. As the knife was flying through the air the Saint started shimmering with a purple glow, the air around him rippling with energy. As the knife moved closer its pace increased and so did its weight, as was the will of it creator. Just before it could hit saints neck a purple disc appeared in its path. The knife disintegrated upon hitting it and before the knife thrower could blink he heard the shot of a long lost weapon of legend, the weapon that wielded the power of a small star, Izanagi's Burden. The next thing he felt was his soul, his will and his body splitting apart from each other. "How had he lost ?" was the last thought that crossed his mind before darkness enveloped him.
